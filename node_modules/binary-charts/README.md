(Demos)[binary-com.github.io/binary-charts/]

## Install by running:

```
npm install binary-charts --save
```

Or by including the file via CDN and a script tag:

```
<script src="https://npmcdn.com/binary-charts@3.16.0/lib/binary-charts.js"></script>
```

## See Demos

```
npm install
npm start
open localhost:9001
```

## Build

To build the project:

```
npm install
npm run compile
```

To run unit tests:

```
npm test
```

For live rebuild during development:
```
webpack --watch
open example/index.html
```

## Usage

Install in your project:

```
npm i binary-charts --save
```

Render the component and pass ticks array to visualize:

```
<BinaryCharts ticks={ticks} />
```

Ticks array is in a format [{ epoch, quote }]. Like:

```
var ticks = [
    { epoch: 123, quote: 95.4 },
    { epoch: 124, quote: 95.3 },
    { epoch: 125, quote: 95.6 }
];
```

## Contract visualization

The component can optionally display the trade parameters or contract already bought.

```
<BinaryCharts ticks={ticks} trade={trade} />
```
or

```
<BinaryCharts ticks={ticks} contract={contract} />
```

Trade and contract properties have the exact format as accepted or returned by the API.

## Trading Times

<BinaryCharts ticks={ticks} tradingTimes={tradingTimes} />

You can optionally provide a trading times object and the Chart will display plot lines visialising open, close and settlement times.

## Dynamic data

Dynamically loading more data when needed by the chart will be available soon.

## Usage outside React projects

The project is currently lightly dependent on React, but will soon be usable without it. Until then, you can integrate a React component in non-React project like this:
